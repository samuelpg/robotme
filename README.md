# ROBOTME

Robotme is a tool for teaching robotics, the goal is to lower the learning curve for students and enthusiants. It was designed with kids in mind, but can be use by anyone who is interested.

**Important**: Robotme is required to run on a RaspberryPi with a WiFi network setup. electrical components such as Servos, DC motors, LEDs, passive buzzers, buttons and PIR sensors are needed. better results are achieved with RaspberryPi Model 3B.

Robotme was developed with Flask, PiGPIO library, and other web technologies such as HTML5, JQuery and CodeMirror.
