#ROBOTME

Robotme is a tool for teaching robotics in schools and lowering the learning curve for students and enthusiants. It was designed with kids in mind, but it can be use by anyone interested in learing robotics without much effort (other than the setup)

Keep in mind that this software and designed hardware are meant to be an introduction to the world of robotics for people without prior knowledge in electronics or programming.

Important: Robotme is required to run on a RaspberryPi with WiFi, electrical components such as Servos, DC motors, LEDs, passive buzzers, buttons and PIR sensors are needed, better results are achieved when it runs on a RaspberryPi Model 3B.

Robotme was developed with Flask, PiGPIO, and other web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
